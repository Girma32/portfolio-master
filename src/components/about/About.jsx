          <p>
            Iâ€™m an emerging developer working with a diverse tech stack as well
            as a broad creative skill set to build full-stack apps and websites.
            I am committed to making sure things are done correctly and will do
            everything within my scope to produce the best results for the task
            at hand. I pride myself in being productive to ensure each task
            placed upon me is done in a timely manner. I am self-motivated and
            fueled by my individual goals I set for myself, and expectations
            others have for me. I'm also passionate about the code that is
            written, and the team members I interact with. I strongly believe
            that having communication & a solid team is key in developing
            innovative projects.
